# Shin Pok√©mon Red and Blue: Lite Patch

Version 1.18

Future bugfixes here will be eventually migrated to the Shin Pokemon Red/Blue master branch

Download the IPS patch file of the version you want and apply it to its respective USA rom.  
Always apply patches to a fresh USA ROM or else strange glitches will occur.  

Important Note: If you are using a save file from a previous version, you might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.
It is best to save outside in Pallet Town before updating to the new patch.

This is primarily a fix-it patch of pokemon red & blue based on the Pret team's disassembly.  
The Lite patch, unlike the full Shin Pokemon Red/Blue, tries to fix bugs and improve the AI with little else changed.
It was done to serve as a codebase for others to start their own romhacks.

***Now with Pokemon Green!***
- The compiler primarily builds using green version's graphics and cerulean cave layout.
- Use the ips patch with a USA Blue rom.


#Latest Fixes (most recent ips patch):
---------------
- Incredibly minor text edits in Green to match the japanese script
- Palette & sound edits in Green
- PP usage is now tracked for both wild and AI trainer pokemon
- There is a chance for the AI to switch a sleeping pokemon based on the sleep counter
  -chance is 0% if counter <= 3
  -chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
- Chances to switch have been reduced:
  - toxic poison - changed probability from 50% to 34%
  - super effective moves - probability weight reduced by 25%
  - only switch out from low HP if player outspeeds enemy (gives the enemy one last shot at dealing damage)
  - an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
  - enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
  - switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
- Patch version now shows on main menu
- Fixed a scrolling text artifact in the credits when running in GBC-mode

#Bugfixes:
-----------

- Battle engine fixes
  - PP usage is now tracked for both wild and AI trainer pokemon
  - Moves no longer have a default 1/256 chance to miss
  - Fixed freeze that occurs in defense stat scaling (def < 4 glitch)
  - Enemy ai ignores type effectiveness for moves that have zero power
     - prevents things like spamming agility against poison pkmn
  - Enemy ai ignores super-effectiveness for moves that do static amounts of damage
  - Fixed skipping move-learn on level-up glitch. 
     - when gaining multiple levels at a time, each in-between level is incrementally checked for moves learned
     - this prevents a pkmn from skipping learnable moves if gaining multiple levels in battle
	 - also does this when evolving via level-up for the new evolution's movelist
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - The function that applies badge stat-ups now selectively boosts the correct stat when called during a stat-up/down effect
  - If player is frozen, the hyperbeam recharge bit is now cleared
     - now matches how enemy mon's recharge bit is cleared upon being frozen
     - this prevents getting stuck in a loop unable to do anything on your turn
  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves).
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
	 - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
     - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective
  - Stat changes from burn and paralyze are applied when the ai sends out a pkmn with those conditions
  - AI routine #2 (prioritize buffing or use a status move) now activates on the 1st turn after sendout instead of the 2nd
  - New custom function for undoing the stat changes of burn and paralysis
    - undoing paralysis is accurate to within 0 to -3 points
    - undoing burn is accurate to within 0 to -1 point
  - PP-up uses are disregarded when determining to use STRUGGLE if one or more moves are disabled


- Move fixes
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters
  - sleep now normal-chance hits a pkmn recharging from hyperbeam, but has no effect if it's already status-effected
  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Substitute fixes
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - Haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Haze resets the enemy and player toxic counter
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage moves (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc) can no longer critically hit
  - fixed-damage moves now obey type immunities
  - fixed-damage moves now ignore effectiveness text & sfx
  - Transform will no longer copy the opponent's Transform move. It's swapped-out for Struggle
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered


- Graphical Fixes
  - Glitched sprites can no longer cause a buffer overflow that corrupts the hall of fame
  - Returning from the status screen when an opponent is in substitute/minimize no longer glitches the graphics
  - PC graphic restored to celadon hotel
  - A tile in cinnabar mansion 3f is slightly modified to prevent getting permanently stuck
  - A tile in cerulean cave 1f adjusted so there isn't a walkable cliff tile
  - After defeating the cerulean burglar rocket, the guard itself always moves to prevent getting stuck in the front door
  - No more ABCD glitched sprites when using teleport without a super gameboy
  - The transitional frame when turning 180 degrees now shows correctly
  - The lower right corner tile of the mon back pic is no longer blanked
  - Amazing man can no longer be triggered by text boxes or the start menu (via a code tweak from Yellow-version)
  - The rival encounters on route 22 now show an exclamation bubble that never showed up originally
  - Erika uses her pic from yellow version which alters her funerary clothes to a proper kimono

  - Great ball has a ball factor of 12 now
  - Stone evolutions cannot be triggered via level-up anymore
  - Ether and elixer now account for PP-ups used when determining if move is at full PP
  - EXP ALL fixes
    - should now dispense the correct exp if multiple pokemon take place in a battle
	- no longer counts fainted pokemon when dividing exp
	- handles exp correctly when all your battle participants are knocked out
  - Fixed a bug where itemfinder can't locate objects with a zero x or y coord
  - Surfboard bugfixes:
	  - cannot use the surfboard if being forced to ride the bicycle
	  - no longer freezes the game when using it from the item menu to get back on land
	  - the menu text will glitch a little, but only for a split-second and does not impact gameplay
  - The Full Heal used by the AI now undoes brn/par stat changes
  - Condition healing items (including using Full Restore at max hp) no longer reset all stats
    - Burn heal undoes the attack stat changes
    - Paralyze heal undoes the speed stat changes
    - Full restore at max hp undoes the stat changes of brn/par
  - Full Restore when used in battle to heal HP now undoes the stat changes of brn/par
  - Pokedoll is disallowed during ghost marowak battle


- Audio fixes
  - Fuschia gym plays the correct sfx when getting the TM from Koga
  - Vermilion gym plays the correct sfx when getting the TM from Surge
  - Restored sfx for getting a badge
    - A sfx is supposed to play when getting a badge, but not for all gym leaders and the sfx used is inconsistent
	- Looks like the idea was dropped in development due to issues with having separate audio banks
	- However, there is a unique unused sfx in the battle audio bank that signifies getting some kind of important item
	- This is likely what was going to be used for getting a badge at some point, and it has been restored


- Misc. fixes
  - Cinnabar/seafoam islands coast glitch fixed (no more missingo or artificially loading pokemon data)
  - Catching a transformed pokemon no longer defaults to catching a ditto
  - Vending machine now checks for the correct amount of money

  - Each of the two boulder puzzles in seafoam islands will fully reset until completed
  - The boulder switches never reset while inside victory road and they will always reset upon leaving
  - While inside victory road, boulders placed on switches will stay there between floor transitions
  - The formula functions for exp now have underflow protection.
  - Added improved general RNG from Prism and Polished Crystal (all DVs are now possible naturally)
  - Cannot bypass Brock via the start button

  - Rage is heavily discouraged
  - Will discourage using Haze if unstatus'd or has net-neutral or better stat mods
  - Will heavily discourage boosting defense against special, OHKO, or static-damaging attacks

- Trainer ai routine #3 (choosing effective moves) has been modified
  - It now heavily discourages moves that would have no effect due to type immunity
  - zero-power buffing/debuffing moves are randomly preferenced 12.5% of the time to spice things up

  - 25% chance to switch if opponent is using a trapping move
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is confused

- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so allows for new functionality:
  - Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
  - Trainer pkmn can now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level
  - These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even swithing)

  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch

- Adjustments to learnsets and base stats
  - Mewtwo can learn Swift by TM
