# Pokemon Ruthless Red

Version 1.0 (BETA)

Elite Four is COMPLETED. Unknown Dungeon has been tweaked slightly to suit the difficulty of the rest of the game. Hidden objects
in all maps have had their coordinates changed to suit the modified map layouts in this game. In some cases, the type of item available
has also been changed. The game is now fully playable.

Version 0.9 (ALPHA)

Victory Road is completed, with four levels of differing map types instead of three identical ones. Fly retains the same effect, PP, and
accuracy it originally had, but its power has been increased from 70 to 85.

Version 0.8 (ALPHA)

Pokemon Mansion is completed. Viridian Gym is completed. The game is complete up until the penultimate Rival battle, which is right before
Victory Road and the Elite Four. It is now possible to collect all eight badges. Ditto received another buff (Transform now provides 20 PP
per move). In order to guarantee escape from wild encounters, your Pokemon's Speed must now be at least 1.33x or 33% higher than that of the 
wild Pokemon.

Version 0.7 (ALPHA)

Seafoam Island is completed. Cinnabar Gym is completed; this does not include Pokemon Mansion, which will serve as an area between Blaine and Giovanni. 
Fire now resists Ice like in later generations. A critical error in a very common A.I. routine that was causing the A.I. to make stupid decisions
has been fixed.

Version 0.6 (ALPHA)

Saffron City is completed. This includes Silph Co., Saffron Gym, and the Fighting Dojo. There is also a Move Reminder and Move Deleter in Saffron City.
Psywave has been tweaked. More adjustments to the A.I. 

Version 0.5 (ALPHA)

Fuchsia City is completed. Over 39 Pokemon have been added to the game. Several changes to existing areas. Several improvements to the A.I. 
The addition of the ARMOR typing and the DEMON typing. And probably a lot more. 
No save file from V0.4 or earlier will survive this update, but saves from V0.5 should function for the foreseeable future.

Version 0.4 (ALPHA)

Celadon City and Lavender Town are completed. 
A relatively large update, involving both Rocket Hideout and Pokemon Tower.

Version 0.36 (ALPHA)

Small update to cut down on grinding. 
All pokemon should now receive a 50% experience bonus after defeating any pokemon.

Version 0.35 (ALPHA)

This is a revision of the A.I. for many trainer classes that are currently available to fight in the game. There is no new content with this update. 
However, the A.I. now much more closely matches what is to be expected throughout the game in the final product. 

Version 0.3 (ALPHA)

This version goes up to the 4th gym, in Celadon City. Leech Seed/Toxic combo is back, Hyper Beam works as it originally did in Gen 1. 
In addition, the level caps are now officially in effect and badge boosts have been removed.

Version 0.2 (ALPHA BEGINS)

This version adds Vermillion City and everything around it. 
It goes up until just before Rock Tunnel. Also, a few additional tweaks.

Version 0.1 (PRE-ALPHA)

The first version of my first Romhack. I'm releasing it for testing, but any save files will likely remain after updates.
Summary: Difficulty + Improvement type of hack. Intended to be Nuzlockable.
This version only goes up to the end of Cerulean City.
